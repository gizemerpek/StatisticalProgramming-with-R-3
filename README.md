# StatisticalProgramming-with-R

1. Please write a R function to do simple and multiple linear regression analyses using matrix 
applications. In this function:
a. Y and single or multiple X variables will be input.
b. Intercept �! and regression coefficients �" for independent X variables will be 
estimated
c. Estimates of Y (�#) and residuals (�̂) will calculated.
d. Total sum of square (TSS), regression model sum of square (RMSS), residual sum of 
square (RSS) and coefficient of determination (R-square) will be calculated.
2. Please write a R function to do model selection based on R-square as a model choice 
criterium in the multiple regression analysis.
a. The R function should list all possible models with total sum of square (TSS), 
regression model sum of square (RMSS), residual sum of square (RSS) and 
coefficient of determination (R-square), e.g:
Model Number of Variables Variable (X) Name TSS RMSS RSS R-Square
1 1 X2 .. .. .. ..
2 1 X4 .. .. .. ..
:
8 2 X2 X5 .. .. .. ..
n 7 X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 .. .. .. ..
The list of models should be from the highest R-square to lowest R-square within number of 
variables.
